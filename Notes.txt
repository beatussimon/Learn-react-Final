In case of useState() hook you have a state and a setState hook to change the value of the state
useReducer:

In case of reducer we have a state and a reducer function and an action which we dispatch 
syntax: const[state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducerFunc, initial_value)

function reducer(state, action){

}

Whenever you want yo make changes to the state, changes should be made inside the reducer function
In useReducer we dispatch an action object which includes the type of action as well as the payload

Then, we have a reducer function which actually modifies the value of the existing state that we have considering the action that we have
